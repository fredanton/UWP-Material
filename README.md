# UWP-Material
A extensive universal windows platform template using material design. Feel free to come with suggestions of what needs to be done or what is missing, i will be updating it graduatly as i make more and more. The target is to make it a fully featured application which will be conected to some sort of external database host (Azure).

I decided to go with the MVVM Basic data structure as it was highly recommended by friends & teachers, feel free to change it to your own needs.

# Features
- Basic Login & Sign Up
- Basic Hashing & Salting of Password
- Custom navigation bar
- Logged in user in a "Session"

# Issues
If you're having issues with the application then consider Restoring NuGet Packages, if that did nothing, then try to clean the solution and rebuild solution (this usually resolves most issues).

Any other then make a request on the github page.
