# UWP-Material
A extensive universal windows platform template using material design. Feel free to come with suggestions of what needs to be done or what is missing, i will be updating it graduatly as i make more and more. The target is to make it a fully featured application which will be conected to some sort of external database host (Azure).

I decided to go with the MVVM Basic data structure as it was highly recommended by friends & teachers, feel free to change it to your own needs.

# What you need to know
To use this source i suggest getting some sort of database, either local or from something like Azure. When you have done this then you need to add the connection string to: "Helpers.Constants.cs".

# Features
- Basic Login & Sign Up
- Password strenght check
- Repeat password check
- Empty boxes check
- Basic Hashing & Salting of Password
- Custom navigation bar
- Logged in user is in a "Session"
- Settings page with custom theme

# Issues
If you're having issues with the application then consider Restoring NuGet Packages, if that did nothing, then try to clean the solution and rebuild solution (this usually resolves most issues).

Any other then make a request on the github page.
