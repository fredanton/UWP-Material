# UWP-Material
A extensive universal windows platform template using material design. Feel free to come with suggestions of what needs to be done or what is missing, i will be updating it graduatly as i make more and more. The target is to make it a fully featured application which will be conected to some sort of external database host (Azure).

# Issues
If you're having issues with the application then consider Restoring NuGet Packages, if that did nothing, then try to clean the solution and rebuild.

Any other then make a request on the github page.
